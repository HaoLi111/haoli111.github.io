Hi, this is Hao. I work on agentic systems and foundation models. 

My Google scholar is https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tDsQ2agAAAAJ&hl=en, most focus on ML+Bio and interpretations of large models. I like to throw information theory and other applied maths, stats into the works (although I am not always lucky). If you really have nothing to do, read my papers.

Also, I am lucky to be one of the very first engineers at the startup--Paradigm.Study https://www.paradigm.study/. 

I used to compete in model airplane aerobatics contests. I learned about chaos and fractals (the picture above) because of aero and multi-body problems I knew of when designing model aircrafts. I took math as undergrad at UC Irvine, but wanted to do something, so I took a few hackathons (and I shamelessly write here: I won some...) went to study Statistics in Columbia University. 

I embrace and criticize AI at the same timeðŸ¤”--but what can I do? If we can bring a little bit of light, then do it. ðŸ”­

Cheers.
